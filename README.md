# About
Because [The official sample](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-ios-sdk) is written in objc, I have made swift original sample.

This sample focuses to make you understand How `Cloud Anchors` work, so I have written the minimum required codes.

# Usage

### 1. Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` into your project

Make firebase project and follow the below document.

https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup

### 2. Put API_KEY into `Const.apiKey`

You can find API_KEY in firebase console setting.
